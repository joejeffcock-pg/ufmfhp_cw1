( groups and graphs to show )
groups:
- extravertedness
- maximum trait of big5 (significant ftr)
- complexity
- realised controlling (N=2 not great)

result:
- godspeed scores
- perceived intelligence
- drop in intelligence
- word count
- duration
- keyword

hist (extravert pop)
boxplot, (percvd int/complexity) - literally the result
bargraph piechart, (keyword/complexity) - application
group bargraph, (word count/duration for each complexity) - show interaction/flow convo
boxplot (some big5/percv int) - counter example

covariance(big5, complexity to everything and then choose)
